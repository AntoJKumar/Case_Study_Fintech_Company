## Coinbase

Coinbase was coined in *2012*, that had the radical idea that anyone- anywhere- should be able to easily and securely access Cyptro assest and act as a catalyst for creating an open financial system around the world.

- Fred Ehrsam (*Goldman Sachs trader*)

## Start point:
    During college days Brain and his roomate started a tutoring company and had to get bank account
setup to start the money flow through it. After couple of day bank gave them a call to inquire about cash flow into the account with all complicated financial terms and it left two gentlemens like a criminal being interrogated.
    Fast forwarding couple of years later Brain joined Air bnb as a software engineer, moving money 
to 190 countries all over the world and in those days US compaines could'nt do businees with Cuba due to regulation.
    Moreover due to credit score which was affected for uncertian reasons and unclear in declining
credit card and transfering of funds from one end to the other was rejected or carried a high fee.
    It seemed like there were no innovation in the financial sector over a period of time when 
introvert moment help him to come across a reserach paper from *Satoshi Nakamto* of having interent decentrailzed and global to pass on the information. This sparked and led towards a solution which could make financial system that was more efficient and open to everyone.
    Finally, the reserach paper kick started coding prototype which eventually ended up becoming *`Coinbase`*

## Technologies used at coinbase:

- **Scaling Serverless Applications**
    - Serverless, specifically AWS Lambda, is awesome. It scales from 0 to near infinity, it costs next to nothing, and it integrates with almost everything.
        - *Fenrir*:
        Fenrir is a secure AWS SAM deployer that can help manage your own serverless projects or scale serverless to a large organization. At its core it is a reimplementation of the `sam deploy` command as an [AWS Step Function](https://blog.coinbase.com/aws-step-functions-state-machines-bifrost-and-building-deployers-5e3745fe645b?gi=fd665a0a4039), so it's a serverless serverless (*serverless^2*) deployer. Fenrir also:

        *Implementation*
        - Aws-sdk-go to interact with CloudFormation and other AWS resources
        - Step as the framework to build, test and deploy AWS Step Functions 
        - Goformation to encode/decode CloudFormation and SAM resources as golang structs   andvalidate them using JSON schema.
    
- **Salus: Scales security automation**
    - Coinbase uses a combination of human-driven code reviews and automates scans to ensure all production deployments are as secure as poosible. One of the tools that have been recently built is called Salus, a docker container that decides which security scanners to run, coordinates their configuration and complies the output into a single report.
    
    We can run Salus on a repository via the Docker daemon and it will determine which scanners are relevant, run them and provide the output. Most scanners are other mature open source projects which we include directly in the container.

    Salus is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines because it becomes a centralized place to coordinate scanning across a large fleet of repositories. Typically, scanners are configured at the repository level for each project. This means that when making org wide changes to how the scanners are run, each repository must be updated. Instead, you can update Salus and all builds will instantly inherit the change.

## Landscape:

- Conibase primary focus is on *Cyrpto & Blockchain*

## Major trends and innovation of this domain (*Blockchain & Cyrpto*)
- *Stablecoin*
    To avoid the volatility stablecoin as been introduced strongly with stable value associate with each coin. As of now, stablecoins are in their initial phase and it is predicted that 2020 will be the year when blockchain stablecoins will achieve their all-time high

- *Blockchain with IOT*
    One of the biggest trends in the world right now is the soaring number of internet-connected devices or IoT. These need a secure and reliable way of communicating with each other. Blockchain is shaping up to be a core underlying technology for the internet of things.

    Blockchain enables devices that aren’t connected with the same software to communicate in a trustless way. This has the potential to create vast interconnected networks of ‘things’ all over the world and help our world run more smoothly.

- *BaaS making blockchain affordable*
    The term applies to a cloud service that makes it easier for clients to develop and run their blockchain apps.

    The benefits are clear. Any business or individual can outsource complicated tech tasks to a BaaS provider. You don’t have to create digital products from scratch, set them up, and control their work. It’s enough to simply pay a fee to a BaaS company, which will then manage the computing part for you. 

- *Scoial networks meets Blockchain*
    [Steemit](https://steemit.com/) which is essentially a decentralized blogging platform. Another promising blockchain social media project, [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) offers a decentralized social media platform that rewards users with tokens for creating and sharing quality content, as well as actively participating in various activities

## Recommendation

- Coinbase has a pretty good platform of product and is one of the leading companies in the cyprto exchange market.
    Some of the drawbacks for coinbase would be the verfication process once the user as compelted it takes much longer processing times to start buying cyptocurries.
    If KYC process is fine tuned then the user would be having quick acess to the market thus leading to increased customer base.
